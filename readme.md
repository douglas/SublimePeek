# SublimePeek
This plugin provides quick access to help files and function information by opening help files in Quick Look. Currently, the plugin only runs on Mac OS but it can be extended to work on other unix systems using gloobus-preview as well as Windows using maComfort. The only supported language right now is R but again, the plugin can be extended to support other languages. 

# Installation
To install SublimePeek, clone or copy this repos to your ST2 packages folder. You also have to clone or copy the repos with the help files for languages you want to use. These are large containing thousands of help files. Currently, SublimePeek-R-help is only one but other will hopefully follow.

# In development
Think twice if you want to install this right now... It's not done!

# Support for other Languages
Adding support for other languages is easy. You just need help files for each function that are called like the respective function. These files should be in a format that is supported by Quick Look (Mac), gloobus-preview (Linux), and maComfort (Windows) such as html or simple text files.
